## Requirements / Purpose

-   Create a functioning Minesweeper game to be played within the Java console
-   Have the functionality of the bombs and numbered squares, printing in the console after input from the player

---

## Build Steps

-   how to build / run project
-   use proper code snippets if there are any commands to run

---

## Design Goals / Approach

-   I wanted to use only text for my implementation
-   I had seen the use of colours to really polish up the game and make it look amazing, but with the instructions given in the MVP I felt purely text was reasonable and suitable
-   I need to add extra borders utilizing || or something of the like

---

## Features

-   Ability to choose the difficulty of the game e.g. easy, hard, or custom games
-   Takes the user input for a custom game: needs the number of desired rows, columns, and bombs
-   Determines which coordinate is chosen from the player's input
-   The game runs until a bomb is detonated/chosen or until the board is cleared, in which a congratulatory message is displayed

---

## Known issues

-   The columns and their titles are not aligned
-   It is hard to read because there are no borders for the whole grid, this is going to be added

## What did you struggle with?

-   I included extensive documentation in my code as I was having trouble getting my head around what each part of my code was doing
